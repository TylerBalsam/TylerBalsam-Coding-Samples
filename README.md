# TylerBalsam-Coding-Samples

A demonstrating of my coding ability, in both TFLearn/Tensorflow (Python) and C++.

This repository currently contains 3 projects:

	1. An autoencoder dual-bottleneck colorization network with a classification output.

	2. A novel autoencoder dual-bottleneck colorization network with a binary classification output.

	3. A class C++ project, implementing a version of the lower level floating point multiplication/division operations.

Here's a brief overview of each project:

	1. Classification Colorization:

	2. Binary Classification Colorization:

	3. Floating Point Multiplication/Division Implementation:
